This is going to be a full-scale Quake-ification of Doom, without
actually using any Quake graphics. That is a word now, DO NOT
QUESTION IT.

Right now, there are Quake-style weapons, armor, and health pickups,
and simple items to represent all of the succeeding.

So far, I have no idea what I'm going to be doing with this in the
future. Maybe I'll add Quake-style monsters, which seems the next
logical step. When 98e comes out, I might bundle in Doom versions
of DM2, DM6, and DM4 (DM2 might be hard). All I know is that I
probably won't be done with this for a good, long time.

Hopefully, by the end of this, I'll be able to play Doom and say "I
could switch to Quake right now and not undergo any change of
strategy". That might be a bit hopeful, but hey, the sky's the limit.
